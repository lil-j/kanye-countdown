## KANYE COUNTDOWN
This is just a quick project I made in anticipation of Kanye West's upcoming album. Made with ReactJS. Fonts and styling selected to match Kanye's previous websites and media. The website also uses a live ticker to show the amount of hours, minutes, and seconds until the album,  accounting for timezones.
Update: It dropped! :)
